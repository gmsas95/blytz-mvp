```bash
# Quick health check
./tests/integration/mvp-final-test.sh

# Check service status
docker-compose ps

# Monitor logs for errors
docker-compose logs --tail=50
```

### Watch For
- ‚ùå Service crashes or restarts
- ‚ùå Database connection errors
- ‚ùå Slow response times (>2 seconds)
- ‚ùå Failed bid placements
- ‚ùå Authentication issues

### Quick Fixes
```bash
# Restart a service
docker-compose restart [service-name]

# Check specific service logs
docker-compose logs [service-name]

# Restart everything if needed
docker-compose down && docker-compose up -d
```

---

## üö® EMERGENCY PROCEDURES

### Service Down
1. **Don't Panic!** Most issues are temporary
2. **Check Status**: `docker-compose ps`
3. **Restart Service**: `docker-compose restart [service]`
4. **Full Restart**: `docker-compose down && docker-compose up -d`
5. **Database**: Run init script if needed

### Database Issues
```bash
# Re-initialize database
cd services/auction-service
./scripts/init-db.sh
```

### Complete System Restart
```bash
# Nuclear option - restart everything
docker-compose down
docker system prune -f  # Clean up
docker-compose up -d
```

### Fallback Mode
If backend fails, the web interface will show mock data:
- Visitors can still see sample auctions
- Registration and bidding will work with demo data
- Tell visitors: "This is a demo mode while we fix the live system"
