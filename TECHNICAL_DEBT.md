# Technical Debt Documentation

This document tracks technical debt, architectural decisions, and lessons learned during the development of the Blytz Live Auction Platform.

## Resolved Technical Debt

### 1. Shared Package Migration (CRITICAL - FULLY RESOLVED ✅)

**Issue**: Incomplete migration of shared packages causing build failures
- **Root Cause**: Two competing shared directories (`/services/shared/` and `/shared/`) with inconsistent package structure
- **Impact**: Build failures in auction service due to missing dependencies
- **Resolution**: Migrated all shared packages to centralized `/shared/pkg/` structure and updated all service imports
- **Current State**:
  - ✅ All services successfully using new `/shared/pkg/` import paths
  - ✅ Duplicate `/backend/shared/` directory removed
  - ✅ Obsolete `/services/shared/` directory removed
  - ✅ Docker-compose updated to use `./services` context for all services
- **Files Affected**:
  - `/home/sas/blytzmvp-clean/services/auction-service/cmd/main.go`
  - `/home/sas/blytzmvp-clean/services/auction-service/internal/api/handlers/auction.go`
  - `/home/sas/blytzmvp-clean/services/auction-service/internal/services/auction.go`
- **Verification**: Created `verify-shared-migration.sh` script to ensure consistency
- **Lesson Learned**: Always complete package migrations entirely before declaring them done - partial migrations create duplicate code debt
- **Cleanup Completed**: Removed all duplicate directories and updated all service references

### 2. Authentication System Architecture (RESOLVED ✅)

**Issue**: Dependency on Firebase Auth with high costs and external dependencies
- **Root Cause**: Initial architecture relied on Firebase Auth ($480-585/month projected cost)
- **Impact**: High operational costs and vendor lock-in
- **Resolution**: Implemented self-hosted Better Auth system with 97% cost savings
- **Implementation**:
  - Complete auth microservice with JWT-based authentication
  - Shared auth client for service-to-service communication
  - Comprehensive test suite and integration patterns
- **Performance Improvement**: ~5ms local queries vs ~100ms external API calls
- **Files Created**:
  - `/home/sas/blytzmvp-clean/services/auth-service/` (complete service)
  - `/home/sas/blytzmvp-clean/shared/pkg/auth/` (shared client)

### 3. Service Port Configuration (RESOLVED ✅)

**Issue**: Inconsistent service port assignments causing confusion
- **Root Cause**: Documentation and configuration drift between services
- **Impact**: Developer confusion and potential port conflicts
- **Resolution**: Standardized port assignments across all documentation
- **Current Port Mapping**:
  - Auth Service: 8084 (previously inconsistent)
  - Product Service: 8082
  - Auction Service: 8083
  - Chat Service: 8088
  - Order Service: 8085
  - Payment Service: 8086
  - Logistics Service: 8087
  - API Gateway: 8080

## Current Technical Debt

### 1. Firebase Functions Integration (PENDING)

**Status**: Integration test failures due to missing function deployments
- **Issue**: Firebase emulators show "Function us-central1-health does not exist"
- **Impact**: Cannot validate complete Firebase integration
- **Next Steps**:
  - Deploy Firebase functions to emulators
  - Verify function naming and regions
  - Complete integration testing

### 2. Database Schema Management (PENDING)

**Issue**: No centralized database migration system
- **Current State**: Manual database setup and schema management
- **Impact**: Difficult to track schema changes and deployments
- **Recommended Solution**: Implement database migration system (e.g., golang-migrate)
- **Priority**: Medium (needed before production deployment)

### 3. Service-to-Service Communication (PENDING)

**Issue**: Direct HTTP calls between services without circuit breakers
- **Current State**: Simple HTTP client calls
- **Impact**: No resilience patterns for service failures
- **Recommended Solution**: Implement circuit breaker pattern and service mesh
- **Priority**: Medium (needed for production resilience)

### 4. Configuration Management (PENDING)

**Issue**: Environment variable sprawl and lack of configuration validation
- **Current State**: Environment variables scattered across docker-compose and service code
- **Impact**: Configuration drift and deployment complexity
- **Recommended Solution**: Centralized configuration service or improved configuration structure
- **Priority**: Low (can be addressed during scaling)


## Code-Level Technical Debt

### Auction Service

- [ ] **Persistence Layer**: Replace mock data and placeholder logic in `services/auction.go` with a real persistence layer (e.g., database or Firebase integration) for all service methods (`CreateAuction`, `GetAuction`, etc.).
- [ ] **Secure ID Generation**: Refactor the ID generation helper functions in `services/auction.go` to use the `crypto/rand` package for generating cryptographically secure, random identifiers instead of relying on `time.Now().UnixNano()`.
- [ ] **Robust Error Handling**: In `internal/api/handlers/auction.go`, add proper error handling for the `strconv.Atoi` conversion when parsing `page` and `limit` query parameters. Return a `400 Bad Request` for invalid input.
- [ ] **Safe Type Assertions**: In `internal/api/handlers/auction.go`, refactor the `userID` retrieval to use the `value, ok := c.Get("userID").(string)` idiom to safely handle cases where the user ID is missing or not a string, preventing potential panics.
- [ ] **Configuration Security**: Remove default secrets (e.g., `JWT_SECRET`, `DATABASE_URL` password) from `internal/config/config.go`. The application should fail fast on startup if critical secrets are not provided via the environment, especially in production.

## Auth Service

- [ ] **Unified Persistence for Auth**: Refactor the `betterauth` client (`pkg/betterauth/client.go`) to use the persistent database via the `Database` interface, removing its internal in-memory user map. This will unify data storage and ensure user data persists across restarts.
- [ ] **Dynamic Role-Based Access Control (RBAC)**: In `internal/middleware/auth.go`, replace the hardcoded user role in `RoleMiddleware` with a dynamic lookup from the database to enable proper role-based access control.
- [ ] **Production Secret Management**: Remove the hardcoded `JWT_SECRET` from `docker-compose.yml`. In a production environment, this should be injected securely using a secrets management system (e.g., Docker secrets, environment variables from a CI/CD pipeline) instead of being committed to the repository.

## Architectural Decisions

### 1. Microservices vs Monolith

**Decision**: Microservices architecture
- **Rationale**: Independent scaling, technology flexibility, team autonomy
- **Trade-offs**:
  - ✅ Independent deployment and scaling
  - ✅ Technology diversity per service
  - ✅ Fault isolation
  - ❌ Operational complexity
  - ❌ Network latency
  - ❌ Data consistency challenges

### 2. Redis for Real-time State

**Decision**: Redis for auction state management
- **Rationale**: High performance, atomic operations, pub/sub capabilities
- **Trade-offs**:
  - ✅ Sub-millisecond latency
  - ✅ Atomic Lua scripts for bid operations
  - ✅ Real-time bid updates via pub/sub
  - ❌ Memory-based storage (requires persistence strategy)
  - ❌ Single point of failure (needs clustering)

### 3. Go for Backend Services

**Decision**: Go for all microservices
- **Rationale**: Performance, concurrency, deployment simplicity
- **Trade-offs**:
  - ✅ Excellent performance
  - ✅ Built-in concurrency
  - ✅ Single binary deployment
  - ✅ Strong type safety
  - ❌ More verbose than some alternatives
  - ❌ Smaller ecosystem than Node.js/Java

### 4. Better Auth over Firebase Auth

**Decision**: Self-hosted Better Auth vs Firebase Auth
- **Rationale**: Cost savings, performance, data ownership
- **Trade-offs**:
  - ✅ 97% cost savings ($15/month vs $480-585/month)
  - ✅ Local performance (~5ms vs ~100ms)
  - ✅ Complete data ownership
  - ✅ No vendor lock-in
  - ❌ Operational overhead
  - ❌ Security responsibility

## Lessons Learned

### 1. Migration Completeness
- **Lesson**: Always complete migrations entirely before proceeding
- **Example**: Shared package migration caused weeks of build issues
- **Solution**: Create verification scripts and checklists for migrations

### 2. Documentation Currency
- **Lesson**: Keep documentation synchronized with code changes
- **Example**: Port numbers and service configurations drifted
- **Solution**: Automate documentation updates where possible

### 3. Integration Testing Early
- **Lesson**: Test integrations continuously, not just at milestones
- **Example**: Firebase integration issues discovered late
- **Solution**: Implement continuous integration testing

### 4. Shared Code Management
- **Lesson**: Establish clear shared code patterns early
- **Example**: Auth client needed refactoring for service integration
- **Solution**: Design shared patterns before service implementation
